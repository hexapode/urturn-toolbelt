## Getting Started

This new command line is very alpha, don't try to use it if your not developping it.
You should still use urturn-cli gem instead of this one (just `gem install urturn-cli` to get started).

1. Checkout the source
2. In the project folder type `npm install` then `npm link`
3. Use urturn-toolbelt -h to get more help
4. Manually upload the generated Zip to urturn.com
